# Finance_Application.
This project is result of my course in school.

# This is my very first project on mobile engineering.
I use react native as frontend technology and expressjs for backend.

This app is about managing personal finance. It has some commom features such as:
1. Managing incomes and outcomes.
2. Take plans.
3. View history and take limitation of some categories of spending.

# Path:
1. Folder backend contains all code for backend and frontend contains all code for front-end developping.
2. report_image contains demo images.
Other files are not much important, they're all about my study in school.
